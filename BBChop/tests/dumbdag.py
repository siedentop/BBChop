# class for computing over directed acyclic graphs.

# the dag is defined by a parents relation: for each index, which indexes are its parents.
# it is required that < and > on indexes is consistent with the transitive closure of the parents
# relation. That is, if parent*(a,b) then a<b and b>a. This is checked.

# this version of the class has a simple O(N^2) implementation for test purposes
